# Output of 'go build'
# If you're building a single binary, you might want to ignore the executable.
# For example, if your main package is in 'cmd/my-app', and you build a binary named 'my-app' in the root:
# /my-app

# Dependency directories
vendor/

# Go module cache
# This directory stores downloaded modules and build cache.
# It's usually located in GOPATH/pkg/mod and should not be committed.
# If you are using Go modules, `go.mod` and `go.sum` are essential and should be committed.
# However, if you have a local `pkg` directory for caching, you might want to ignore it:
# pkg/

# Editor-specific files
.idea/
.vscode/
*.swp
